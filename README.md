# LogoScan — AI-Powered Logo Infringement Detection

## The Problem

In today’s competitive business landscape, brand identity is everything. As more companies launch and design tools become more accessible, the risk of logo plagiarism and trademark infringement increases significantly.

Key challenges include:

* Rising cases of similar-looking brand logos due to AI-generated and template-based designs
* Time-consuming, subjective, and inconsistent manual logo comparison
* High legal costs related to trademark disputes and enforcement
* Lack of tools to proactively detect potential conflicts before launch or registration

## The Solution

**LogoScan** is an AI-powered solution that helps identify potential trademark infringement and logo similarity by analyzing both visual and textual elements.

LogoScan compares two logos and provides a detailed similarity score based on:

* Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction and comparison
* Dominant color palette analysis for visual identity overlap
* Deep visual feature extraction using Vision Transformers or VGG16
* Structural similarity metrics to assess layout resemblance
* A final aggregated similarity score with an infringement risk assessment

## Key Features

* OCR-based text similarity using EasyOCR and fuzzy string matching
* K-means color clustering for palette comparison
* Visual embeddings generated from deep learning models (ViT or VGG16)
* Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for layout comparison
* Streamlit-based interactive interface for uploading and comparing logos
* Clear, interpretable output to assist legal and branding decision-making

## Use Cases

* Trademark validation for legal and compliance teams
* Originality checks for branding and design agencies
* Pre-launch logo assessment for startups and product teams
* Automated monitoring of uploaded logos in digital marketplaces
* Competitive analysis in intellectual property research
